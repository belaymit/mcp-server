# MCP Server Documentation



## Introduction

The MCP Server is a proxy server designed to implement the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling seamless communication between clients and a variety of backend services, such as large language models (LLMs), knowledge bases, and external APIs (e.g., Gemini, GitHub, Google Drive). The server acts as an intermediary, handling complex request routing, response aggregation, and tool integration, while providing a unified interface for clients.

## Supported Backend Services and Integrations

The MCP Server is designed to integrate with a variety of backend services and tools, enabling flexible orchestration and aggregation of data and actions. The main supported service types include:

- **File System**: Enables reading, writing, and managing files and directories on the server or remote systems. Used for tasks such as file uploads, downloads, and content manipulation.
- **GitHub**: Integrates with the GitHub API to provide repository management, commit history, pull requests, and other version control operations.
- **Playwright**: Supports browser automation and end-to-end testing by controlling browsers programmatically for tasks like UI testing, scraping, and workflow automation.
- **Google Drive (GDrive)**: Connects to Google Drive for file storage, retrieval, and sharing, supporting document management and collaboration workflows.
- **Gemini**: Integrates with Gemini LLMs for advanced language processing, text generation, and conversational AI tasks.
- **Other LLMs**: Supports integration with additional large language models for natural language understanding and generation.
- **Knowledge Bases**: Connects to structured and unstructured knowledge sources for information retrieval and enrichment.
- **Custom APIs**: The server can be extended to communicate with other RESTful or RPC APIs as needed for specific use cases.

These integrations are modular and can be enabled or configured as required by the deployment environment or application scenario.


### What Does the Code Do?

The codebase provides a robust, extensible proxy server that:
- Receives and processes client requests using the MCP protocol.
- Forwards requests to appropriate backend services (LLMs, knowledge bases, APIs).
- Aggregates and normalizes responses from multiple sources.
- Handles errors, logging, and configuration management centrally.
- Supports integration with various tools and services, making it adaptable for different use cases and environments.

### What Are the Main Tasks?

1. **Request Routing:** Determines the correct backend service(s) for each client request and forwards the request accordingly.
2. **Response Aggregation:** Collects and combines responses from multiple services, presenting a unified result to the client.
3. **Tool Integration:** Integrates with external tools and APIs, such as LLMs, Gemini, GitHub, and Google Drive, to extend server capabilities.
4. **Configuration Management:** Loads and validates configuration files to control routing, security, and environment-specific settings.
5. **Error Handling and Logging:** Provides centralized error handling and detailed logging for maintainability and debugging.
6. **Testing and Validation:** Includes comprehensive tests and mock data to ensure reliability and correctness.

### How Does It Work?

- The server is initialized via entry points in the `mcp_proxy_server/` directory (e.g., `main.ts`, `app.ts`).
- Incoming requests are processed by the router, which uses configuration files to determine routing logic.
- Requests are forwarded to backend services using modules like `request-forwarder.ts`.
- Responses from services are aggregated by `response-aggregator.ts` and returned to the client in a normalized format.
- Error handling and logging are managed by dedicated modules (`error-handler.ts`, `logger.ts`).
- Tool integration modules enable communication with LLMs and external APIs.
- The codebase is organized for modularity, making it easy to extend, test, and maintain.


## 1. Code Functionality and Task Requirements

The MCP Server project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) proxy server that facilitates communication between clients and various backend services, including LLMs, knowledge bases, and external APIs. Its primary tasks include request routing, response aggregation, error handling, and integration with tools such as Gemini, GitHub, and Google Drive. The server is designed to be extensible and configurable for different environments (development, production, etc.).


### Test Coverage and Importance

**What is Tested:**
- Core proxy logic: request forwarding, response aggregation, and routing.
- Integration with mock servers for GitHub, Filesystem, and Google Drive.
- Error handling and edge cases (invalid responses, timeouts, retries).
- Configuration validation and loading.
- Tool integration and discovery mechanisms.

**How Testing is Done:**
- Unit tests for individual modules (e.g., request forwarder, aggregator, error handler).
- Integration tests using mock servers to simulate real backend services and verify end-to-end flows.
- Use of Jest as the test runner, with configuration in `jest.config.js` and setup in `jest.setup.js`.
- Mock data and servers are provided in `mcp_proxy_server/__tests__/mock-servers/` and `mock_knowledge_base/`.
- Tests are organized for clarity and maintainability, covering both typical and edge-case scenarios.

**Why Testing is Important:**
- Ensures reliability and correctness of the server under various conditions.
- Detects regressions early when making changes or adding features.
- Validates integration with external services and APIs.
- Provides confidence for refactoring and extending the codebase.
- Supports maintainability and onboarding of new contributors by documenting expected behaviors through tests.
