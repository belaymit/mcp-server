# MCP Proxy Server Progress Update

## Current Status

I have successfully implemented the foundational components of the MCP Proxy Server project, including the core configuration management system with environment variable resolution, the request forwarding mechanism with timeout handling and retry logic, and the LLM integration service supporting Gemini. The project structure is fully set up with TypeScript, proper logging with Winston, and all necessary dependencies including dotenv for environment variable management. The main proxy server components are operational and can start on port 8000, with the web UI server configured to run on port 3000, though I'm currently troubleshooting a Gemini API authentication issue that's preventing the LLM integration from functioning properly.

## What's Been Completed
- ✅ Project structure and core dependencies setup
- ✅ Configuration management system with YAML parsing and validation
- ✅ Request forwarding mechanism with HTTP client implementation
- ✅ LLM integration service with Gemini support
- ✅ Environment variable configuration and dotenv integration
- ✅ Basic server lifecycle management and logging

## What's Next
- 🔧 Fix Gemini API authentication issue (currently debugging header vs query parameter format)
- 📋 Implement routing system with prefix and header-based strategies
- 🔄 Build response aggregation system for method discovery
- 🌐 Complete web UI frontend with React-based chat interface
- 🔗 Add WebSocket communication for real-time updates
- 🧪 Create comprehensive testing suite with mock servers

## Web UI Overview
The web UI is designed as a modern chat-based interface that allows users to interact with MCP tools through natural language prompts, featuring real-time status indicators for connected MCP servers and their available tools. The interface will provide seamless integration with the LLM service to automatically invoke appropriate MCP tools based on user requests, displaying both the conversation flow and tool execution progress in an intuitive dashboard format.
